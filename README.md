# Leetcode solutions for [NeetCode.io](https://neetcode.io)

### Updates

I will periodically update the neetcode.io site with new solutions for this repo!

### Contributing

To contribute, please fork this repo and open a PR against `main` for a problem that does not yet have a solution in a given language.

Solutions needed (will be linked from [NeetCode.io](https://neetcode.io)):
* Java
* Javascript

Solutions are also welcome for any other supported language on leetcode.com!

In order to get your PR reviewed as quickly as possible, please:
- adhere to existing naming conventions for files/directories
- prefer adding only one solution per PR (not a hard and fast rule, but will typically make the review cycle shorter)
- ensure your code is consistently formatted according to the language you're writing in (there are free online formatters: [formatter.org](https://formatter.org/) and [textmagic](https://freetools.textmagic.com/source-code-formatter) to name a few)
- ensure your code passes submission on [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com)

Complete:
* Python
* C++

Please feel free to open a pull request to add solutions in other languages for the Neetcode 150 problem list. If you would like to have collaborator permissions on the repo to merge your own PRs or review others' PRs please let me know.
